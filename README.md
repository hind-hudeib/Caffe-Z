# Caffe-Z

I have created a web page for a caf√©, the user will be asked about his\her name and gender, after which a welcome message will be shown, then they will be asked about their drink. I used HTML & CSS to build and design the page and JavaScript language to ask the user the previous questions.

 ### Tools that I used :
 - visual studio
 - Figma
